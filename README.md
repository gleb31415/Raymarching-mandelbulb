Mandelbulb Visualizer
This project is a simple Mandelbulb visualizer built using Python's tkinter library. It generates a 2D projection of the 3D Mandelbulb fractal using ray marching techniques.

Customization
You can customize the following parameters directly in the script:

cams: Camera position, defined as a tuple (x, y, z).
light: Light source position, defined as a tuple (x, y, z).
ang: Field of view angle in radians.
close and far: Near and far clipping planes for the ray marching algorithm.
as well you can redefine the object class by implementing new distance function. No additional changes would be needed to plot the figure
